                        In order to address all three criteria , I decided that my project will&nbsp;have:
                    </p>

                        <li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        After establishing the criteria of success for my project,
                        I began brainstorming an individual topic (within the broad category of climate change) that my
                        project will explore.
                        In the end, I've decided to focus on the topic of <b>global warming as a result of anthropogenic
                            CO2&nbsp;emissions</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted my poster to pull the audience in, while the zine informs them about the context of the
                        poster.
                        A couple of topics I initially wanted to dive into more for the zine&nbsp;included:

                            Increased intensity and frequency of&nbsp;bushfires.

                    <p>
                        In order to have reliable information as foundation of my project, a lot of research was done
                        through scientific and academic sources.
                        One of the starting points I used to find the impacts and current statistics of global warming
                        was the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/"><i><b>NASA Climate Change and Global Warming</b></i></a> website
                        (NASA, 2021). This website provided me with the graph indicating CO2 levels overtime used in the second
                        spread. It also prompted me to explore the <b>issue of acidification</b> caused by the absorption of CO2 in our&nbsp;oceans.
                    </p>
                    <p>For statistics related to the topic of melting icecaps in spread 3, I used statistics
                        sourced from the <a
                            href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_level.html"><i><b>National
                                Snow & Ice Data Center</b></i></a> website which stated that "glaciers fringing
                        the
                        Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, contributed 27 ± 22 millimeters to global mean
                        sea
                        level rise from 1961 to 2016" (NSIDC, 2019). Meanwhile, statistics related to
                        increased
                        severity and frequency of domestic bushfires as a result of global warming (in
                        spread 5)
                        was found on the <a
                            href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/not-normal-climate-change-bushfire-web/"><i><b>Climate
                                Council</b></i></a> website (Climate Council, 2019). For more information on
                        acid
                        rain, I looked at the linked journal article from the NASA climate website from
                        USGCRP
                        (Wuebbles&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon reading more articles, I also learnt that CO2 contributions from individuals and
                        domestic activities were quite insignificant compared to emissions from large
                        companies
                        (Riley, 2017). Since this is a lesser-known fact, I found it crucial to include in
                        the
                        zine to emphasise the importance of speaking out against environmentally unethical
                        business&nbsp;practices.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the research process, I've developed five topics to be explored in the
                        &nbsp;zine:</p>

                <div class="sectionCopy">
                    <p>
                        After researching and settling on five main topics to explore, I began thumbnailing possible illustrations for the zine spreads and for the&nbsp;poster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first thumbnails I did, the zine was designed in a portrait orientation. 
                        There were also ideas for additional attachments to the zine such as polaroids and care tags. 
                        However, since the size of the zine was smaller than originally planned, the polaroid cannot fit into the zine. 
                        The care tag idea was also scrapped since the A1 poster could not physically fold down to become a cover for the A7 sized&nbsp;zine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later thumbnails explored different poster ideas and added upon the initial ideas for the zine spreads. 
                        At this stage, I've decided that a landscape orientation allows for a better display of text at a small size. 
                        The zine layouts from the secondary thumbnails were essentially the final designs used for the project. 
                        The other illustrative concepts for the poster have been rejected due to their tendency to fall under cliche&nbsp;tropes.

                        Experimentation and iteration for this project involved physical material and digital&nbsp;experimentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Physical experimentation involved the exploration of mark-making using ink, as well as the use of gouache and watercolour. 
                        Originally, the spread with plants was going to be made using ink impressions of real plants achieved during experimentation. 
                        However, using traditional medium in only one spread made it visually incoherent, so it was abolished altogether. 
                        Gouache as a medium was difficult to control and the colours were also inconsistent. 
                        As such, I opted for digital illustration for the entirety of the zine&nbsp;process. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Digital experimentation for the zine did not take much time, as I limited myself to a colour palette 
                        of only black and white and red. This is because I felt that this colour scheme works well to communicate 
                        the idea of heat. I did however, experiment with alternative colours of the world map used for the zine cover. 
                        I chose to go with the black land and red seas since pollution is often carried out on land but 
                        causes the heating up of ocean&nbsp;waters.

                        Illustrations for the zine was completed using Procreate on the iPad and typesetting was done on InDesign. 
                        The first iteration of the zine featured a wide gutter on the centerfold to accommodate for a stitch that cut 
                        through the zine's edge. However, this was changed in the final iteration as the saddle stitch allowed for a cleaner aesthetic. 
                        The atlas used for the cover spread of the zine was edited from a vectorised world map in the public&nbsp;domain.

                        The final stage of the project involved printing and construction of the zine. 
                        This involved choosing paper stock, binding technique, and print settings. 
                        Initial prints of the zine was completed using cartridge paper while later iterations were printed on 52gsm Tomoe River paper through a home printer. 
                        The final zine was Riso&nbsp;printed.
