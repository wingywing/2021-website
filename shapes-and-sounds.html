                        <b>Shapes and Sounds</b> is a collection of short motion graphic exercises made to convey stories 
                        through only basic shapes accompanied by audio. The first animation (with the narration) uses a snippet of <i><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/arts/denice-frohman-poem.html">Denice Frohman's self-narrated 
                            poem: Lady&nbsp;Jordan</a></b></i>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The squares animation and tangram flower animation has 
                        audio that I've mixed myself, using sounds from royalty-free archives such as <b><i><a href="https://freesound.org/">FreeSound</a></i></b> and 
                        <b><i><a href="https://freesfx.co.uk/">FreeSFX</a></i></b>. Some of the audio were self-recorded as&nbsp;well.

                    Ideation and <br class="bigbreak">storyboarding

                        For each of the animations, a process of ideation and storyboarding was necessary to reach the final&nbsp;result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the narrated piece featuring Frohman's <b>Lady Jordan</b>, the short stanza of the poem was analysed and annotated on
                        to come up with visuals that can convey the tone and meaning of the poem. Since some parts of the snippet were 
                        in Spanish, I also had to use a translation tool to understand the jist of its&nbsp;meaning. After that, a styleframe storyboard
                        was created to be animated in After&nbsp;Effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The squares animation and tangram flower animation had a less directed brief, so I started off with storyboarding
                        the beats of the narratives. While I was animating the two videos, some parts of the storyboard were cut out. For 
                        the squares animation, the retaliation of the larger square was removed to suggest a more filial relationship between
                        the two shapes. Meanwhile, the flower animation originally featured a square sun in the background of the storyboard, but 
                        was removed since it made the scene feel too&nbsp;cluttered.

                    Technical research
                </h3>
                <div class="sectionCopy">
                    <p>
                        While I was creating the animations for these videos, there were times where I had to search online for solutions
                        to problems that I haven't faced&nbsp;before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the squares animation, I had to research how I can create a <b>smear frame</b> without manually adjusting the curve. 
                        From <b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd4ekENw7XM">FLOWTUTS's Youtube video</a></i></b>, I learnt to use the <b>echo</b>
                        effect to simulate a traditional&nbsp;smear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For both the squares and flower animation, a lot of research went into sound design. This involved finding resources for 
                        public domain sounds and learning to use Premiere Pro instead of After Effects for faster live audio playback (honestly a 
                        lifesaver since my workflow became heaps faster!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The audio for the squares animation was mostly inspired by old <b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDdkC9T4qC0">Looney Tunes</a></i></b> and <i><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1C4rSoMKEw">Popeye the Sailor Man</a></b></i> animations. Particularly, the
                        whistling exhale sound after a snore. On the other hand, I wanted the flower animation to have more of an elegant
                        feeling. Thus, I used classical music as non-diegetic sound (the climax of <b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBGkOF7rBDQ">Grieg - Peer Gynt Suite No 1: Morning Mood</a></i></b>),
                        and subtle sound effects for the movement of the camera and tangram&nbsp;pieces.
